### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About Me
Welcome to my GitHub, my name is Alvaro, and i'm a recent grad of LearningFuze looking for a jr. developer position. Through my interests with gaming and computers, coding became something I gained a passion for relatively quickly . I have experience with JavaScript, React, Node.js, etc, and am excited for an opportunity to learn new technologies.
